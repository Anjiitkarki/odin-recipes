# odin-recipes

This the first odin project of the course.
It's about creating the outlook of the basic website containing the cooking recipes implementing the HTML knowledge that's taught in the foundations chapter of the course.

So, in this project I'm just revising the HTML foundation knowledge and trying to create a basic website using link, list and other basic HTML elements.
