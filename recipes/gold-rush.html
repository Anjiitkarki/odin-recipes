    <h1>Gold Rush</h1>
    <p style='margin:0;'>A Gold Rush cocktail is a riff on a whiskey sour using honey syrup instead of simple syrup.
    <br>The honey syrup is commonly made with a 1:1 ratio of honey to water, but I find that a 2:1 ratio
    <br>helps to better balance out the lemon juice and bourbon. This makes enough syrup for 4 cocktails.<br> 
    Serve over a large ice sphere.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li><h3>Honey Syrup:</h3></li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        </ul>
    <li><h3>Cocktail:</h3></li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>2 cups ice</li>
            <li>2 fluid ounces bourbon</li>
            <li>3/4 fluid ounce honey syrup</li>
            <li>3/4 fluid ounce fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>lemon twist, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>    

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p><b>Step 1</b>
    <br>In a small saucepan, combine honey and water over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring, until honey is dissolved. 
    <br>Remove from heat and cool completely. To account for evaporation, add a splash of water to bring the total volume of syrup up to 3 fluid ounces, if necessary.</p>
    
    <p><b>Step 2</b>
    <br>Add 1 cup of ice to a cocktail shaker. Add bourbon, honey syrup and lemon juice. Cover and shake until chilled, 15 to 20 seconds. 
    <br>Fill a rocks glass with remaining ice cubes or 1 large ice sphere and strain cocktail over the ice. Garnish with lemon twist.
